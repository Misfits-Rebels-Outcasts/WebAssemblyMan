           <h3>What is Blazor?</h3>
		<p class="first-letter">

      Blazor is a WebAssembly based front end web application framework that uses .NET, C# and HTML.
      It is open source and maintained by Microsoft and the community to address the many challenges encountered
      in developing single page applications.</p>
      
      <p>Note - Blazor is currently experimental and should not be used in production. This website is still under construction.</p>
             
      <h3>How does Blazor works?</h3>
      
      <p>A Blazor app consists of compiled .NET assemblies that are downloaded and run in a web browser using a WebAssembly-based .NET runtime. The app can also call into 
      JavaScript or access the DOM through Javascript interop APIs. As Blazor is a component-based framework that supports features such as bindings, direct access to the DOM is minimized.</p>
