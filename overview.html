               <h4>Brief overview on building your sample/example project</h4>

<p>
1. Let's assumed that you have spent time learning Rust WebAssembly and studied our previous tutorials. And now, you are ready to create a sample project.
After investigation, you think that you are insterested to learn and implement samples for <a href=https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/struct.Document.html>web_sys::Document</a>.
At this point, simply drop us a message to check with us to reserve this struct for your implmentation.
</p>
<p>
2. Select 5 (or 10 depending on which stage you are in) functions from this Struct. Let's assumed that you have selected the following functions to create examples for.
</p>

    <div class="quote-bordered" style="text-align:left;background:black"> 
      <pre><code style="color:white;">
pub fn create_element(&self, local_name: &str) -> Result&lt;Element, JsValue>
pub fn body(&self) -> Option&lt;HtmlElement>
pub fn get_element_by_id(&self, element_id: &str) -> Option&lt;Element>
pub fn get_elements_by_class_name(&self, class_names: &str) -> HtmlCollection
pub fn get_elements_by_name(&self, element_name: &str) -> NodeList
            </code></pre>                  
        </div>
<p>
After selection, please inform us of your selection to prevent duplicate implementation with others. 
We may also provide you with advice to start with more popular or widely used functions. The key is to communicate with us continuously.
Initially, we will typically allow you you to reserve the entire struct (and even a few more without naming the functions specifically) for implementation.
</p>
<p>
3. In your command line, enter the following command to create a new sample project.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>cargo new web_sys_document --lib</kbd>
</p>
<p>
For consistency, change the Struct name from Document to lower case "document" when we use it in our project name. We will also like to append the crate name "web-sys" in front with the "-" replace as an underscore "_".  The final project name becomes "web_sys_document". 
</p>
<p>
If you have selected a Struct from js-sys, you can use "cargo new js_sys_xxx --lib" where "xxx" is the Struct name in lower case.
</p>
<p>
4. Once the project is created, change the Cargo.toml file to include the "features" required. 
</p>
<p>
Cargo.toml
</p>
<p>
    <div class="quote-bordered" style="text-align:left;background:black"> 
      <pre><code style="color:white;">
.
.
.
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
js-sys = "0.3.32"
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.55"

[dependencies.web-sys]
version = "0.3.4"
features = [
  'Document',
  'Element',
  'HtmlElement',
  'Node',
  'Window',
]             
            </code></pre>                  
        </div>
</p>
<p>
5. Let's say we want to implement a sample for the "create_element" function. We will modify "lib.rs" to be as follow: 
    <div class="quote-bordered" style="text-align:left;background:black"> 
      <pre><code style="color:white;">
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

//Create a paragraph element and append it to the HTML body.
pub fn document_create_element()
{
    let window = web_sys::window().expect("global window does not exists");    
    let document = window.document().expect("expecting a document on window");
    let body = document.body().expect("document expect to have have a body");
    let val = document.create_element("p").unwrap();
    val.set_inner_html("Hello World from WebAssemblyMan!");
    body.append_child(&val).unwrap();
}

#[wasm_bindgen(start)]
pub fn start() {
    document_create_element();
}
            </code></pre>                  
        </div>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Recommendations</strong>
</p>
<p>
Make sure the example is place in a function (e.g. "document_create_element" : Struct name in lower case followed by "_" and the "create_element" function name.) as shown above.
</p>
<p>
Make sure the example is meaningful and illustrates what the "create_element" function does.
</p>
<p>
Make sure to add a meaningful description of the function as comments.
</p>

<p>
6. Compile the program in the command line terminal with the following:
</p>
<p>
<kbd>wasm-pack build --target web</kbd>
</p>
<p>
7. Next, add an "index.html" file and import the generated "web_sys_document.js"
    <div class="quote-bordered" style="text-align:left;background:black"> 
      <pre><code style="color:white;">
&lt;html>
    &lt;head>
      &lt;meta content="text/html;charset=utf-8" http-equiv="Content-Type"/>
    &lt;/head>
    &lt;body>  
      &lt;script type="module">
  
        import init from './pkg/web_sys_document.js';
  
        async function run() {
          await init();
        }
    
        run();
      &lt;/script>
    &lt;/body>  
&lt;/html>
            </code></pre>                  
        </div>
</p>
<p>
8. In the folder containing "index.html", run the following command to launch the project.
</p>
<p>
<kbd>python3 -m http.server</kbd>
</p>
<p>
You can also use other http server such as "cargo install basic-http-server" and then "basic-http-server".  
</p>

<p>
9. Launch your browser (Chrome or Firefox) to test the output on "127.0.0.1:8000". You should see "Hello World from WebAssemblyMan!". The complete example is available at the following for reference:
</p>
<p>
https://github.com/Misfits-Rebels-Outcasts/WebAssemblyMan-rustwasm/tree/master/rustwasm/web_sys_document
</p>
<p>
10. Finally, proceed to implement examples for the other functions.
    <div class="quote-bordered" style="text-align:left;background:black"> 
      <pre><code style="color:white;">
document_body();
document_get_element_by_id();
document_get_elements_by_class_name();
document_get_elements_by_name();
            </code></pre>                  
        </div>
</p>
<p>
See how the examples will be used for documentation on our website.

<p>
<strong>Important Notes</strong>
</p>
<p>
Take time to learn, understand and appreciate Rust WebAssembly while you build the samples. The thing we value most is the knowledge you have gained.
</p>
<p>
A good place to learn is https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/tree/master/crates/web-sys/tests/wasm. You can also look at HTML/Javascript samples and then implement it in rustwasm. 
</p>
<p>
We recommend starting with the easier HTML***Element (e.g. HTMLParagraphElement) etc. Let's say you are implmenting for HTMLParagraphElement (web_sys_htmlparagraphelement), make sure NOT to implement the methods found in the base (Deref Target HTMLElement, Element) class
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Further Steps</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Create a GitHub account if you do not have one yet. You will soon be contributing to WebAssemblyMan GitHub repository through Fork/Pull Requests. You may also be creating web pages through a Static Web Site Generator. We will be sharing more with you soon.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hint : This is a golden opportunity to build up your GitHub account, which may be your biggest takeaway besides the knowledge gain.
