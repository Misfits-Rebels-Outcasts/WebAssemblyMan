</p>
<p>
For example, in our <a href=https://github.com/Misfits-Rebels-Outcasts/WebAssemblyMan-rustwasm/tree/master/rustwasm/js_sys_array>js_sys::Array sample</a>, we implemented the following functions: new, new_with_length, push, from and set.
After selecting the functions, Whatsapp or Email to inform us of your selection. This is to avoid duplication with others who are also working on the project.
Once we confirmed the selection, proceed to build your sample project. 
</p>
<p>
Send us the project in a zip file (src/lib.rs, Cargo.toml and index.html), we will provide recommendations to change or improve the project.
When implementing the sample functions, remember that it will be used for documentation purposes. This means, the sample should illustrate meaningfully how a function is used.
Once the project is approved, get paid $100RM. 
</p>
<p>See <a href=https://www.webassemblyman.com/overview.html> how to build your example project</a>.</p>

<h5>Phase 2</h5>
<p>
Congratulations on the completion of Phase 1. From here, you can decide whether you want to continue with Phase 2 by letting us know.
Phase 2 is basically repeating Step 5 (with 10-20 functions or other higher level component samples, and probably providing some HTML documentation through GitHub) at your own pace. You will be provided $100RM per project.
In time, you will be an expert in the most exciting web technology today. Please feel free to work at your own pace. When you are having exames or tests, simply drop us a note to indicate that you are busy. When you feel like doing more, feel free to implement as many function examples as you like, and earn more at the same time.
